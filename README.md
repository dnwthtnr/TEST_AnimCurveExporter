    Thank you for giving me the chance to do this test as I had a lot of enjoyment doing so regardless of the 
    restricted time I was able to spend on it.

    Time wise I spent around 6 hours on the code here spread across the small amounts of time I was 
    able to take in between my busy work schedule. I look forward to hearing back and hopefully moving forward!
    Be sure to reach out with any questions in regard to decisions I made or if you run into any issues.
