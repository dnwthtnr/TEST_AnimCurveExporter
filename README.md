# AnimCurveExporter

    # Description
    
    This tool was created as a technical test to be able to export and import animation curve data onto objects 
    in Autodesk Maya. The goal time allotted was 6hrs and this was completed within that time frame.


    # This tool was developed using Python 3.7 and tested within Autodesk Maya 2022.1.


    # Setup

    -Open up the 'shelfbutton.py' file at the root of this package.
    -Change the '[THIS FILE DIRECTORY]' to the full path to the package file directory
    -Create a shelf button in Maya with the given code and it should work as intended from there


    Thank you for giving me the chance to do this test as I had a lot of enjoyment doing so regardless of the 
    restricted time I was able to spend on it.

    Time wise I spent around 6 hours on the code here spread across the small amounts of time I was 
    able to take in between my busy work schedule. I look forward to hearing back and hopefully moving forward!
    Be sure to reach out with any questions in regard to decisions I made or if you run into any issues.
